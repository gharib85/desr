# desr

*desr* is a package used for Differental Equation Symmetry Reduction and is particularly useful for reducing the number of parameters in dynamical systems. It implements algorithms outlined by Evelyne Hubert and George Labahn <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. The Masters dissertation [Differential Algebra and Applications](http://tanbur.github.io/desr/dissertation/differential_algebra_and_applications.pdf) that inspired this project places the algorithms into the theoretical framework of <em>differential algebraic geometry</em> and shows how to extend them to parameter reduction of arbitrary systems of partial differential equations, though this is not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This package requires the Sympy package.

### Installing

To install, download the package and run:
